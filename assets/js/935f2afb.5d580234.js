There are sensors already hosted by Waggle and also sensors that are being integrated into Waggle as a user-hosted sensor. A sensor does not necessarily mean a physical device, but can be a program producing measurements from data -- we call it software-defined sensor. Once those sensors become available in Waggle nodes edge applications running inside the nodes can pull measurements from the sensors to process them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/accessing-data":{"id":"tutorials/accessing-data","title":"Access and use data","description":"Data Movement","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/cloud-compute":{"id":"tutorials/cloud-compute","title":"Cloud compute & HPC on edge data","description":"Waggle provides a number of interfaces which other computing and HPC systems can build on top of.
