# Building your own Waggle Device

Talk about why someone woudl wnat to make their own waggle device
- Why someone would want to create their own waggle device ?  (for local development, classroom, etc.)

## Potential Use Cases (better title)

Think about the target audience:
- a professor that wants to introduce this to his students and wants to make 20+ units
- someone interested in Waggle and making an app but doesnt have access to production nodes
- someone that wants to use a new sensor (that is not in the waggle network) (i.e. a new camera, a new bat singal detector, a new custom sensor they built)
  - link this "Bring your own sensor to Waggle" (./access-waggle-sensor.md)

reference minji's concept paragraph (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KrCU5IS5vUCSB6lj7th1JgUz4y7lYBclk5NJP_5Ijoc/edit#)

## Support platforms

Talk about the currently only supported platform (nano) and Links to the node-platforms repo for the Nvidia Nano
- https://github.com/waggle-sensor/node-platforms/tree/main/nvidia-nano

(put a note about future supported platforms: https://github.com/waggle-sensor/node-platforms)
- a user if they are interested can even add a new platform to the above

After following the tutorials above for hte platform (i.e. nano)
- a link to “my devices” where u (will eventually) be able to see all yoru devices that you have previously registered
