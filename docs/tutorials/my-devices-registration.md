In order to register your waggle device, you will need keys to authenticate your device with beehive when setting up your nano device. To get registration keys, enter your device ID on "My Waggle Devices" page, click "Get Keys" button, then it will generate a zip file for you. Check your downloads folder for the zip file, then move it to the same folder with the ansible script to proceed.
